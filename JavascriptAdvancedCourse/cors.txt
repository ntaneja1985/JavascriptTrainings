Browser sends a pre-flight request
It sends Access-Control-Allow-Origin
and the method like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE

In the server we need to enable CORS
and we need to enable Access Control Allow Origin and Access-Control-Allow-method
All of this is done in the pre-flight request.

ACCESS CONTROL ALLOW ORIGIN
ACCESS CONTROL ALLOW METHOD

The above headers are required only when we send
the requests in the browser via HTTP

HTTP Request Headers have the following:
1. METHOD TYPE: GET/POST/PUT/DELETE
2. Host info
3. User-Agent: browser/curl etc
4. ACCEPT */*

HTTP Response Headers have the following details:
1. HTTP Status code 200/301/401 etc
2. location
3. Content-Type: text/html
4. Cookie with Expires Date
5. Cache-Control: public max-Agent
6. Content Length
7. Security Headers like
X-XSS-Protection
X-Frame-Options: SAME ORIGIN
